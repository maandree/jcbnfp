jcbnfp has two methods for testing @code{@value{PACKAGE}.Program.main(String...)} and
@code{@value{PACKAGE}.Highlighter.main(String...)}, the first prints to stderr, and the
later prints to stdout. Both in colour so you may want to pipe to @command{less -r}.

@code{@value{PACKAGE}.Program} takes three command line arguments: the syntax file,
the code file to parse, the root definition to use.

@code{@value{PACKAGE}.Highlighter} takes one command line argument, the syntax file,
which is then printed in colours to show how it is parsed.
